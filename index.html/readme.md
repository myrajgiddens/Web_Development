My name is Myra Giddens.

I created this project which is a web development portfolio site where I can feature my skills and build upon as I get more skilled.

This project contains an about me, work, home, and contact page. 

The site will be first primarily used as a place to showcase what I learn throughout the course and to give users insight into my professional and personal interests. 

The site has basic functionality with easy to locate links to navigate in between pages. 

The technologies I used were: html, css, and bootstrap. I also used code from formspree.io, googlefonts.io, and animista.

Some ideas for future improvement are: reposition elements on the page to optimize user experience, add in more bootstrap to make the navigation bar responsive, add more animations to add to visual appeal, and include more links for users to interact with.
